# HierAMuS - A hierarchical higher order and multiscale simulation finite element program

I started this project around 2016 as a Ph.D. student as a private project to learn C++. I dropped the program for some years. In the meantime, I started reusing it, realizing that it offers great flexibility in designing different finite element structures. 

As the code matured, I decided to make it publicly available.
